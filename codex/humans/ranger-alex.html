        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Alex Brettson is the older of Captain Tracy’s two nephews—and he takes his role as a Junior Ranger very seriously. Brave to a fault, Alex believes space needs heroes, and he’s willing to jump headfirst into danger to prove he’s one. He’s memorized every rule in the Ranger Manual but often forgets to ask if they apply. Loyal to his uncle and fiercely protective of his younger brother Erik, Alex is convinced the best way to learn is by doing. And shouting.</p>
