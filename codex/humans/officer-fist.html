          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Role:</strong> Munitions Officer aboard the <a href="/codex/transportation/sunshine.html">Sunshine</a></li>
            <li><strong>Affiliations:</strong> <a href="/codex/factions/gold-tier-crew.html">Gold Tier Crew</a>, <a href="/codex/factions/dispatch.html">Dispatch</a></li>
            <li><strong>Episode Appearances:</strong> Episode 3 (and more to come)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subject-summary">
          <h3>Biography</h3>
          <p>No one remembers when Fist joined the crew. Some say he was already in the weapons bay when they arrived. Others swear he was listed as “Support Intern #77” until the day he taped a “Munitions Officer” badge to his jumpsuit and started calling the shots.</p>

          <p>Fist is obsessed with firepower, sabotage diagrams, and overcomplicated detonation mechanisms. He speaks in grunts and acronyms, most of which are made up. Despite his volatile personality and complete lack of formal training, Cheyenne allows him to remain aboard—possibly out of fear, possibly because his chaos has saved the crew more than once.</p>

        <h3>Key Traits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weapon of Choice:</strong> “Whatever explodes loudest”</li>
          <li><strong>Catchphrase:</strong> “That button? That’s the one you don’t press.”</li>
          <li><strong>Habitat:</strong> The munitions cubicle (he carved it out himself)</li>
          <li><strong>Known For:</strong> Installing unnecessary explosives and labeling them “training devices”</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
        <p>Officer Fist represents a certain chaotic truth of interstellar operations: sometimes the most dangerous person in the room is the one Dispatch overlooked. While his methods are questionable, his loyalty to the Sunshine—and Cheyenne’s indirect approval—make him a core part of the Gold Tier Crew's success (and messes).</p>
        <p>He’s a hazard, a hero, and a lawsuit waiting to happen. But he’s <em>their</em> hazard.</p>
