                    <h3>Backstory</h3>
                    <p>The **Space Pirates** are a loosely organized network of interstellar raiders, smugglers, and outlaws who thrive on the chaos of the fractured galaxy. While there are many pirate factions, the most notorious are the **Skull Pirates**, led by the infamous <strong>Captain Washington</strong>. These pirates raid trade convoys, smuggle illicit goods, and wreak havoc across corporate territories, leaving destruction in their wake.</p>
                    <p>Not all pirates align with the Skull Pirates’ brutal methods. Groups like the **Red Hooks** focus on smuggling and minor raids, often avoiding conflict with corporate forces. However, no pirate crew is entirely trustworthy, as alliances shift as quickly as their profits rise and fall.</p>

                <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
                <p>The **Space Pirates** are a constant threat to stability in the fractured galaxy. Their raids disrupt corporate supply chains, while their smuggling operations fuel the black market. Despite their disorganized structure, their sheer numbers and resourcefulness make them a force to be reckoned with. The Skull Pirates, in particular, embody the darker side of piracy, blending brutality with cunning leadership under Captain Washington. The Moonshine Crew frequently encounters these raiders, whose unpredictable nature adds tension and excitement to their interstellar adventures.</p>
