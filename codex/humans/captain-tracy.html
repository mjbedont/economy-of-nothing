        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Captain Tracy once saved the universe. Then nothing changed. Now, he captains the <strong>Moonshine</strong>, taking dispatch gigs from the Nothing Corporation while quietly trying to outwork the system. Revered and forgotten in equal measure, he’s become a relic of a previous era — trying to teach the next generation that doing things the right way still matters, even when no one is watching. Beneath his flair and theatrics is a lonely man desperate to prove that decency isn't dead weight.</p>

        <li>
          <details>
            <summary>Saved the universe (offscreen)</summary>
            No one remembers how. No one seems to care. But the plaque on Brenner 7’s bar wall used to say “Savior of Everything.”
          </details>
        </li>
        <li>
          <details>
            <summary>Adopted his nephews as Junior Rangers</summary>
            Turned family into crew. Believes teaching them by doing is better than keeping them safe and ignorant.

        </li>
        <li>
          <details>
            <summary>Publicly clashed with Dispatch protocol</summary>
            Refused to cut corners on a delivery mission, despite losing leaderboard points. Called it “a stupid system for stupid people.”
          </details>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
      <p>Tracy is the moral compass no one asked for. Unlike Cheyenne, who climbs the ranks, or Mr. Green, who games the numbers, Tracy believes in doing the right thing — even if it costs everything. He may be a relic, but he’s also a rebel: trying to teach the system to care, one reckless dispatch at a time.</p>

        <li>"Being right doesn’t matter if nobody knows you were."</li>
        <li>"If I wanted to win, I’d play the game. I’m here to change it."</li>
        <li>"Yes, I know the rules. That’s why I broke ‘em the right way."</li>
        <li>"You think I’m lucky? Buddy, I outworked the algorithm."</li>
        <li>"Every time I save the day, someone files a complaint."</li>
