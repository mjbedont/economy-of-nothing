      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Mukluk, once known (and rightfully mocked) as <strong>Snow Boots</strong>, is a frozen resort world rebranded by the Nothing Corporation’s Lifestyle Acquisition Division. Beneath the glossy chalet brochures and hand-curated snowfall lies a darker truth: it’s a favorite drop zone for freelance bounty hunters and corporate debt enforcers.
      </p>

      <h2>Tourism Highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Notable Terrain:</strong> Endless powder fields, hidden crevasses, and suspiciously well-heated lodges</li>
        <li><strong>Peak Activity:</strong> Apres-ski shootouts, sauna ambushes, polite interrogation in hot tubs</li>
        <li><strong>Key Exports:</strong> Designer cold-weather gear, memories people paid to forget, missing persons reports</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>In the Show</h2>
      <p>
        Mukluk serves as the icy pressure cooker for a psychological cat-and-mouse arc between <a href="/codex/characters/captain-tracy.html">Captain Tracy</a> and <a href="/codex/characters/erik.html">Erik</a>. Stranded during a routine debt-evader retrieval mission, the two must survive waves of hostile contractors in a deadly homage to <em>The Shining</em> — complete with malfunctioning lifts, cryptic room keys, and an aggressively haunted ski instructor.
      </p>

      <h2>Corporate History</h2>
      <p>
        Mukluk’s original name was dropped after market testing revealed "Snow Boots" evoked cold feet and refund requests. Since rebranding, the Nothing Corporation has leaned heavily into curated exclusivity: the entire planet is technically an invitation-only wellness experience. Most guests never leave. (Or if they do, they’re quiet about it.)
