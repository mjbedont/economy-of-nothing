          <li><strong>Role:</strong> Strategist and Financial Controller of the <a href="/transportation/moonshine.html">Moonshine</a></li>

        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Mr. Green is the quiet brain behind the Moonshine’s operations — a master tactician, expert economist, and unnervingly good at reading people. Though little is known about his origin, he appears to be an alien of considerable intelligence and possibly hybrid ancestry. Assigned by Dispatch to monitor Tracy’s missions, he quickly became indispensable — even if no one really knows his endgame. Some say he’s just trying to make money. Others believe he’s playing a far bigger game.</p>

      <h3>Key Moments</h3>
      <ul class="key-moments">
        <li>
          <details>
            <summary>Joined the Moonshine Crew (via Dispatch)</summary>
            Technically assigned as an observer and strategist, but he slowly took over every spreadsheet on the ship.
          </details>
        </li>
        <li>
          <details>
            <summary>Bankrolled Cheyenne’s orphanage initiative</summary>
            Claims it was "just a tax write-off." No one believes him.
          </details>
        </li>
        <li>
          <details>
            <summary>Survived the Gladiator Pits of New Rome</summary>
            Entered the arena with nothing but a calculator and a plan. Left a legend.
          </details>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
      <p>Green represents the seductive allure of logic and control. While Tracy trusts instinct and Cheyenne trusts strategy, Mr. Green trusts numbers. He believes systems can be exploited — and sometimes improved — if you know the rules better than anyone else. Whether he’s building wealth or building revolutions is unclear. But one thing is certain: if he’s on your crew, the math will always add up... eventually.</p>
