                    <h3>Backstory</h3>
                    <p>After the corporate success of brain implants as communication tools, public backlash and unforeseen side effects led corporations to innovate further. The next stage in evolution was the creation of **Cell Phones**, devices made entirely from organic matter. These phones are grown from synthetic cells, giving them the ability to self-repair minor damage and adapt to varying environmental conditions.</p>
                    <p>The organic nature of these phones allows for a deeper integration with their users, offering real-time biofeedback and customizable interfaces that can literally grow to meet the userâ€™s needs. However, their dependency on genetic engineering and limited network coverage has made them yet another tool of corporate control.</p>

                <!-- Key Features Section -->
                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Organic Composition:</strong> Built from synthetic cells that mimic biological processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Healing:</strong> Minor scratches and damage are repaired over time by cellular regeneration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptive Signal Reception:</strong> Grows additional "signal nodes" for stronger reception in weak coverage areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate Networks:</strong> Coverage varies significantly by region, often limited to corporate-owned zones.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
                <p>Cell Phones in <em>The Economy of Nothing</em> highlight the extremes of corporate innovation and control. While they offer revolutionary features like self-healing casings and organic adaptability, their reliance on proprietary ecosystems ensures users remain tethered to corporate networks. Coverage limitations and high maintenance fees make them both a marvel of technology and a constant reminder of corporate overreach.</p>
