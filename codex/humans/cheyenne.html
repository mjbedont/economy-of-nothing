        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Known throughout the Dispatch ranks as Captain Cheyenne, her true name—<em>Shyan</em>—originates from a mysterious orphanage she rarely discusses. This early life in the shadows shaped her leadership style: precise, quiet, and powerful.</p>

        <p>Cheyenne leads the <a href="/codex/factions/gold-tier-crew.html">Gold Tier Crew</a>, a matryoshka-style fleet operated by a hand-picked force of unpaid interns. She balances her dominance in the <a href="/codex/factions/dispatch.html">Dispatch</a> system with compassion for those under her command, though few know what drives her beyond leaderboard perfection.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Key Moments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Deployed the Sunshine — a nesting doll-style ship — staffed entirely by interns</li>
        <li>Oversaw a mission to retrieve the Dragon Egg on <a href="/codex/locations/dracronaria.html">Dracronaria</a></li>
        <li>Outranked <a href="/codex/humans/captain-tracy.html">Captain Tracy</a> on the Dispatch leaderboard, sparking tension</li>
        <li>Rumored to be secretly funding an orphanage or training facility for lost youth</li>
        <li>Operated as both a captain and a pilot, qualifying her for multiple Dispatch categories</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
      <p>Cheyenne is one of the highest-ranking officers in the Dispatch system. Her ability to manipulate both strategy and image has made her a force in galactic operations, and a rival or ally depending on the mission. Though technically outranking <a href="/codex/humans/captain-tracy.html">Captain Tracy</a>, their philosophical split is what defines their dynamic: he wants to do good. She wants to do better.</p>
      <p>Whether Cheyenne is building a legacy, a rebellion, or a rescue program — only she knows. And she’s not telling.</p>
