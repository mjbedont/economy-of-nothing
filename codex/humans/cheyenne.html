      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>Cheyenne rose through the elite orphan pipeline of Dispatch, quickly achieving Gold-Tier status. By combining the roles of both Captain and Pilot, she maximized her profit share and built a personal fleet of unpaid interns to pilot her matryoshka-style ship: the <strong>Sunshine</strong>. Her tactical brilliance is matched only by her ability to outmaneuver the system itself. Rumors persist that she secretly funds an off-grid orphanage and may view the Dispatch system as both a means to success and a moral contradiction.</p>

    <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
    <p>Cheyenne represents the logical extension of Dispatch’s meritocracy — she plays by the rules, but better. Her success challenges the Captain’s slower, more idealistic methods. Though they technically operate within the same structure, Cheyenne outranks him due to her combined leaderboard metrics. She rarely brags, but the shine of the <em>Sunshine</em> speaks for itself.</p>
