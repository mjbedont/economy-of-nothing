        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Captain Red Hook is the self-declared face, name, and fashion designer of the Red Hooks Crew. He named the crew after himself, claiming it was “for branding purposes.” While his leadership skills are… debated, Red Hook commands attention wherever he goes — mostly by talking louder than anyone else in the room.</p>
        <p>Operating out of Dispatch on Planet Prime, he’s constantly trying to one-up Captain Tracy while simultaneously dodging actual work. That said, he does know how to rally a crew — especially when there’s camera coverage involved.</p>

      <h3>Key Moments</h3>
      <ul class="key-moments">
        <li>
          <details>
            <summary>Refused to assist in the Brenner 7 raid rescue</summary>
            Opted to “wait and see” while sipping fruit smoothies at Dispatch. “You can’t rush brilliance,” he reportedly said.
          </details>
        </li>
        <li>
          <details>
            <summary>Challenged Captain Tracy to a “Leadership-Off”</summary>
            Results were inconclusive, though Red Hook insists he won on style points.
          </details>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
      <p>Red Hook serves as both comic relief and a cautionary tale. He’s not incompetent — just extremely committed to doing things his way (i.e., flashy, loud, and probably trademarked). In contrast to more grounded crews like Shyan’s or the Moonshine team, the Red Hooks represent what happens when ego meets corporate freedom a little too hard.</p>
