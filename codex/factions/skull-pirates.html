                    <h3>Backstory</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>Skulls</strong> are a semi-intelligent species native to the Badlands of Brenner 7. Their skeletal appearance and tribal culture inspired the infamous <strong>Skull Pirates</strong>, who adopted their imagery and name as a symbol of fear and rebellion. While many Skulls live as nomadic tribes, some have been co-opted into the pirate ranks, though others resist this association.</p>
                    <p>Skulls are known for their intricate bone-like exoskeletons and sharp intellect, which allow them to adapt and thrive in the harshest environments. Their society is built around survival and dominance, with strong tribal leaders guiding their herds. Despite their aggressive reputation, not all Skulls are hostile, and some even engage in trade with daring settlers.</p>
