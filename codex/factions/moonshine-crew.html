      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The Moonshine Crew operates under the banner of the Nothing Corporation, but with a style all their own. Formed by <a href="/codex/humans/captain-tracy.html"><strong>Captain Tracy</strong></a> and staffed with hand-picked allies (and a couple of family members), the crew balances chaotic missions, moral ambiguity, and galaxy-scale existential crises—usually while arguing over who’s really in charge.</p>

      <p>Their ship, <a href="/codex/transportation/moonshine.html"><strong>The Moonshine</strong></a>, is a modified dispatch vessel known for its stubborn durability and questionable fuel economy. Despite scoring low on corporate efficiency metrics, the Moonshine Crew has a reputation for getting the job done—with flair, resistance, or collateral damage depending on the day.</p>

          <summary>Rescue operation on <strong>Brenner 7</strong></summary>
          Clashed with the Skull Pirates while extracting civilians from a badlands outpost. Officially labeled “salvage.” Unofficially: “A moral stand with fireworks.”

          Prevented a corrupted Tamagotchi uprising. <a href="/codex/aliens/mr-green.html">Mr. Green</a> later denied involvement. The Captain claimed it was “a heartfelt misunderstanding between childlike wonder and murderous code.”

      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Multiple leaderboard infractions</summary>
          Frequently penalized for not choosing the “fastest” solution. Proudly ranks low on efficiency but high on fan conspiracy boards.

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reputation</h3>
    <p>The Moonshine Crew is both admired and ridiculed. They’re seen as outdated romantics by the leaderboard-obsessed elite and as stubborn heroes by those trapped in the margins. Their friction with the Nothing Corporation is well-known but tolerated—for now. Dispatch calls them “a useful anomaly.”</p>
