      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The Sunshine Crew is a sleek, elite, and technically overqualified team operating under the command of <a href="/codex/humans/cheyenne.html"><strong>Captain Cheyenne</strong></a>. Unlike traditional crews, the Sunshine is a <strong>matryoshka-class</strong> ship, capable of splitting into layers—each with its own pilot, crew, and function. This design lets Cheyenne run multiple simultaneous operations, and makes her one of the most efficient captains in the system.</p>

      <p>Known for their tactical superiority and unnerving calm, the Sunshine Crew often completes their missions before others even finish the paperwork. Interns are used liberally and often questionably. If the Moonshine Crew is a blunt-force rebellion, the Sunshine Crew is a precision strike disguised as corporate compliance.</p>

    <h3>Known Operations</h3>
    <ul class="key-moments">
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>The <strong>Dragon Egg Heist</strong> on Dracronaria</summary>
          Under Cheyenne's lead, the crew flipped the job’s political goal to support rebels rather than royals. Corporate HQ called it a “tactical success with unfortunate optics.”
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>Development of the <strong>Signal-ER Device</strong></summary>
          Built by Cheyenne to bypass Dispatch’s centralized routing. The crew uses it to coordinate multi-deck ops with total autonomy.
        </details>
      </li>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>The <strong>Intern Fleet Maneuver</strong></summary>
          Unpaid interns piloted auxiliary ships to pull off a six-pronged decoy run. Most of them survived. Dispatch denied liability.
        </details>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reputation</h3>
    <p>The Sunshine Crew is feared, respected, and envied. Their ruthlessly efficient methods put them at the top of Dispatch's performance charts—even if some question the ethics behind their results. Captains like Tracy see them as cautionary tales. Shareholders see them as the future.</p>
