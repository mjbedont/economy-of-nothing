                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cosmic Dollar:</strong> Universal currency for inter-corporate transactions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Corporate Credits:</strong> Company-issued currencies used by workers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conversion Rates:</strong> Favor corporations, making exchanges costly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Corporate Banking:</strong> Systems designed to retain control over credits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <!-- Key Details Section -->
                <h3>Key Details</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cosmic Dollar:</strong> 
                        The universal and primary currency for large, inter-corporate deals. Rarely used by the average worker, the Cosmic Dollar is a tool of corporate elites and galactic trade. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate Credits:</strong> 
                        Workers are paid in corporate-specific credits, such as **Nothing Credits** or **Cosmic Entertainment Coins**, which are locked to the company’s ecosystem. While these credits can theoretically be converted to Cosmic Dollars, the process is deliberately costly and inefficient.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Conversion Rates:</strong>
                        Conversion between credits or to Cosmic Dollars involves high fees, ensuring most workers remain economically tied to their corporations.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate Banking:</strong>
                        Corporations provide their own banking systems, discouraging withdrawals or transfers through penalties and exorbitant fees.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Examples Section -->
                <h3>Examples of Corporate Credits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nothing Credits:</strong> 
                        Exclusive to employees of the **Nothing Corporation**, these credits can only be spent on goods and services within the Nothing ecosystem.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cosmic Entertainment Coins:</strong> 
                        Used by those employed or entertained by Cosmic Entertainment, these coins purchase media, products, and experiences within the corporation’s offerings.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Role in the Universe Section -->
                <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
                <p>The currency systems of **The Economy of Nothing** reflect the corporations' stranglehold on the galaxy’s economic flow. By creating isolated ecosystems of proprietary credits, corporations ensure dependency and minimize financial freedom for their workers. The Cosmic Dollar serves as a reminder of the power disparities, accessible only to the elite while the average citizen remains trapped within their corporate credit systems.</p>
