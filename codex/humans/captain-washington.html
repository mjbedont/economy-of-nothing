        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Captain Washington leads the Skull Pirates with flair, firepower, and frightening efficiency. He walks the line between space warlord and glam generalissimo — wearing cybernetic upgrades like fashion statements and commanding fleets like theater productions.</p>
        <p>Though officially affiliated with Dispatch, Washington mostly does what he wants, when he wants — unless there's a higher profit in pretending to follow orders. Beneath the epaulets and glowing monocle is a mind that always plays the long game. And wins it.</p>
