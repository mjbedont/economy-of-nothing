      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The Pooh Crew is one of the most inexplicable units operating under the Dispatch umbrella. Composed entirely of bears with enhanced cognition, rudimentary speech, and questionable obedience, they are led (or more accurately, wrangled) by a single human handler named <a href="/codex/humans/lance.html"><strong>Lance</strong></a>. No one is sure why they exist. No one can figure out how they’re still funded.</p>

      <p>Despite their oddball nature, the Pooh Crew has completed high-risk salvage, recon, and even diplomatic missions—though the outcomes are rarely clean and never repeatable. Some claim they were part of an early biogenetic taskforce. Others think they’re a prank that got out of hand. Lance insists “the bears are the only ones who still listen.”</p>

    <h3>Reputation</h3>
    <p>The Pooh Crew is equal parts feared and adored. Their unpredictability makes them a last resort, but their sheer persistence gets results—eventually. They occupy a strange mythic tier among Dispatch crews, passed around in rumors, memes, and one horrifying children’s book adaptation.</p>
