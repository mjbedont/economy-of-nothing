                    <h3>Backstory</h3>
                    <p>Dracronaria is a high-fantasy world steeped in ancient power struggles and draconic legacies. The mountainous landscape is dominated by fortresses, flame-temples, and noble territories held together by blood, debt, and arcane treaties. Dragons were once rulers here — some say they still are, just in more bureaucratic forms.</p>
                    <p>The planet is technically independent but has increasingly fallen under the shadow of off-world interests. Chief among them is the <strong>Nothing Corporation</strong>, whose "Worldbuilding Division" maintains a discreet yet deeply embedded presence under the guise of infrastructure support and narrative continuity management.</p>

                    <li>The <strong>Treaty of Draconic Peace</strong> was signed, ensuring cooperation between noble houses and ancient dragonkind.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Egg of Divine Right</strong> vanished from the royal palace under mysterious circumstances, triggering a multi-faction investigation.</li>
                    <li>The Moonshine Crew responded to Queen Serravelle's Level 7 Client Services call, uncovering rebel activity near the Hall of Echoes.</li>
                    <li>A rebellion led by <strong>Lord Pendrake</strong> challenged the throne's legitimacy, citing the Egg’s disappearance as proof of fraud.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Role in the Universe Section -->
                <h3>Role in the Universe</h3>
                <p>Dracronaria sits at the crossroads of myth and modernity — a planet whose medieval traditions continue to resist total corporate absorption. Its dragon-linked history, political volatility, and rich natural resources make it both a symbolic stronghold and a strategic asset. As the Nothing Corporation expands its influence, Dracronaria’s fate may hinge on who holds the Egg — and whether the planet’s stories still belong to its people, or its sponsors.</p>
