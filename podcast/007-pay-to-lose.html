      In this episode, Mike Allen, Ryan, and Mike Bedont improvise the foundation of what
      might be the most playable metaphor in the galaxy: a board game where the goal isn’t

      You'll hear the real-time evolution of <em>The Economy of Nothing™: The Board Game</em>,
      Cheyenne’s emotional arc taking shape, and the crew figuring out how macroeconomics,
      personal betrayal, and late-stage capitalism all fit into a game night from hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus: character emotions, Inside Out references, and the debut of the official FTS
      (*Free Thinker Society*) fan club.
