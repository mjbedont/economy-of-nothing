                    <h3>Backstory</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>Moonshine</strong> started its life as an ordinary red pickup truck, rusting away in the corner of an old mechanic's shop on <strong>Planet Prime</strong>. Captain <strong>Raymond B. Tracy</strong>, in need of a reliable vehicle for short-distance hauls, purchased it for next to nothing. Little did he know, this humble truck would eventually become the backbone of his interstellar adventures.</p>

                    <p>After a series of unexpected events involving hyperspace anomalies and a hasty retrofit, the <strong>Moonshine</strong> was reborn as a spaceship. Its iconic red paint job and truck-like cockpit remained intact, making it a symbol of both nostalgia and ingenuity. Upgraded with state-of-the-art thrusters, reinforced plating, and glowing panels, the <strong>Moonshine</strong> now soars through space, blending rugged charm with high-tech functionality.</p>

                    <p>When <strong>Captain Tracy</strong> expanded his crew, the truck-turned-spaceship was modified again to include a <strong>crew cab</strong>, ensuring there was room for the <strong>Brettson Rangers</strong> and other adventurers. Despite its transformation, the <strong>Moonshine</strong> never lost its heart—a pickup truck with a story as big as the stars.</p>
