      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Pawdora is a planet entirely populated by sentient canines — not uplifted Earth dogs like <a href="/codex/creatures/mississippi.html">Mississippi</a>, but a distinct evolutionary lineage of dog-like beings who formed civilizations long before humans figured out indoor plumbing. Their society is advanced, hierarchical, and runs almost entirely on vibes and scented declarations.
      </p>

      <h2>Cultural Traits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Governance:</strong> A rotating council of pack alphas, guided by prophetic tail wags</li>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Bones. Literal ones. No one's sure why it works, but it does</li>
        <li><strong>Core Values:</strong> Loyalty, territory, and dramatically timed howls</li>
        <li><strong>Forbidden Acts:</strong> Fake throws, vacuum worship, off-leash taxation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>In the Show</h2>
      <p>
        The crew visits Pawdora during the events of <em>"Who Scoops the Scoopers’ Poops"</em>, a diplomatic episode-turned-misadventure where Mr. Green is accidentally worshipped as a divine emissary. The arc begins subtly with a bone-sharing ceremony and escalates until he's at the center of a cult movement involving glowing tennis balls and mysterious belly-rub rites.

      <h2>Mississippi vs Pawdora</h2>
      <p>
        Although <strong>Mississippi</strong> is a dog, she is not of Pawdoran origin. She was an Earth-born hound who gained sentience under unexplained circumstances (possibly related to a minor eldritch clerical error). The Pawdorans view her as something between a folk hero, a cautionary tale, and a really weird cousin who insists she’s "from the old country."
